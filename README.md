# PINE: A Library of Supporting ML, Language, Vision, Speech, Robotics & Neuroscience Algorithms in JAX.

Principal Developer - Henry Ndubuaku (ndubuakuhenry@gmail.com)

# What We Are Building
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Flax, SciKit Learn, Theanos etc. all support swift model development as well as standard pre-processing and evaluation. However, advances in AI has introduced a hoard of pre-processing, post-processing, reinforcement learning, activation and evaluation algorithms. Pine is a helper library that hopes to include as many of these techniqes as possible. We are building with Jax for peak performance and ensuring its usable with any library.
